# About the Teacher, Rebecca Shue

I am a local homeschool parent and a certified IEW instructor with over fifteen years of experience teaching IEW to all levels of students. I completed my Early Childhood Education associate degree and certificate at Cuyamaca Community College. My bachelor’s degree (with an honors thesis in gifted children) and multiple subject credential work was done at University of San Diego, my reading specialist certificate was completed at University of California San Diego, and my master’s work and special education credential was completed at Cal State University San Marcos. I homeschooled both of my children through high school and recognized just how important sold writing skills are to college success. I consider parents to be their child’s primary teacher, but I recognize that, as homeschool parents, it is sometimes helpful to hire out certain subjects. I have graduated both of my own homeschool students. One is enrolled in college. The other has already graduated college.
