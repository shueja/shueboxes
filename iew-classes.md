title: IEW Classes 2026-2027
---

Learning to write well is one of the most important skills for predicting school and life success. It is also a subject that many homeschool parents struggle to teach well. With that in mind, I offer writing classes for homeschool students. The classes are a lot of fun and include instruction in composition, grammar, vocabulary, and public speaking. These are core classes. You can see more of my qualifications at www.shueboxes.com.

## Cost

The cost for each class includes 75 minutes of class time per week, paper editing and grading as well as guidance to help the parent educator teach their child. Students who are new to me will have a one-time $50 supply fee in addition to the material fee for the class. I will start collecting a non-refundable $65 material fee now to reserve seats. The rest of the tuition will not need to be paid until August. I am a vendor for several charter schools. I am happy to become a vendor for other schools, but I will not start the vendor process for a new charter school until I have received your material fee. Due to the extra time involved in billing through a charter school, I will charge an extra $25 per year for charter pay families.

## Location and day

Classes are taught in my home classroom on Wednesdays in South Escondido, near Felicita Park.

All classes will meet from late August-early June.

## Other details

The age levels for these classes are not firm. If you have a child outside of the recommended age range (i.e., gifted or learning disabled) that you think would be a good fit for the class, please touch base with me. I am quite comfortable with the full range of students, and we can discuss which class would be most appropriate.

I can also modify the grammar level within the class. If your child has not had grammar instruction, begin with one of the earliest books. If you completed the book that is listed for a particular class previously, we will simply move your child up.

All classes come with recommended literature to extend what is learned from the source texts. This reading is optional for all but the Narnia class.

I limit my class sizes to assure personal attention for each student. If you have a student in each class, the other student is welcome to use my yard or dining room as a study hall. Younger children are welcome to play in our large backyard with parent supervision.

A Zoom option will be offered for each class in case of illness or vacation. I am not accepting full time Zoom students for these classes.

## About the teacher, Rebecca Shue

I am a local homeschool parent and a certified IEW instructor with over fifteen years of experience teaching IEW to all levels of students. I completed my Early Childhood Education associate degree and certificate at Cuyamaca Community College. My bachelor’s degree (with an honors thesis in gifted children) and multiple subject credential work was done at University of San Diego, my reading specialist certificate was completed at University of California San Diego, and my master’s work and special education credential was completed at Cal State University San Marcos. I homeschooled both of my children through high school and recognized just how important solid writing skills are to college success. I consider parents to be their child’s primary teacher, but I recognize that, as homeschool parents, it is sometimes helpful to hire out certain subjects. I have graduated both of my own homeschool students. One is enrolled in college. The other has already graduated college.
